    "We've spent some time going into detail about some of the data types and structures available in python. It's now time to talk about how to navigate through some of this data, and use data to make decisions. Traversing over data and making decisions based upon data are a common aspect of every programming language, known as control flow. Python provides a rich control flow, with a lot of conveniences for the power users. Here, we're just going to talk about the basics, to learn more, please consult [the documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "A common theme throughout this discussion of control structures is the notion of a \"block of code.\" Blocks of code are demarcated by a specific level of indentation, typically separated from the surrounding code by some control structure elements, immediately preceeded by a colon, `:`. We'll see examples below. \n",

    "Python provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced. Indentation refers to the spaces that may appear at the beginning of some lines of code. This is a particular aspect of Python's syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages, indentation is optional and is generally used to make the code visually clearer. But in Python, indentation also has a syntactic meaning. Particular indentation rules need to be followed for Python code to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are two ways to indent some text: by inserting a *tab character* (also referred as `\\t`), or by inserting a number of spaces (typically, four). It is recommended to use spaces instead of tab characters. Your text editor should be configured such that the *Tabular* key on the keyboard inserts four spaces instead of a tab character.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Notebook, indentation is automatically configured properly; so you shouldn't worry about this issue. The question only arises if you use another text editor for your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, what is the meaning of indentation? In Python, indentation delimits coherent blocks of code, for example, the contents of a loop, a conditional branch, a function, and other objects. Where other languages such as C or JavaScript use curly braces to delimit such blocks, Python uses indentation."
